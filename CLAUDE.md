## What this system is

AM Copilot is an **AI intelligence layer** that sits on top of CTM (CallTrackingMetrics).
It scores admissions intake calls for a behavioral-health treatment center, explains those
scores with evidence, and surfaces coaching opportunities for managers.

**CTM is the system of record. AM Copilot is the intelligence layer.**

- Webhooks in from CTM
- REST API out to the dashboard
- Derived insights stored only (~10 MB/agency/year)
- CTM executes all operational actions

AM Copilot does NOT replace CTM. It does NOT store recordings. It does NOT store full transcripts.

---

## Phase A scope — the only scope that exists right now

Phase A proves one question: **can AI score admissions calls reliably enough to create
operational trust?**

- 17 working days
- Synthetic data only — no real patient data, no PHI, no BAA required
- 30 synthetic calls across 5 scenario types
- Success criterion: ≥80% overall agreement, ≥70% per dimension with client blind grading
- Day 17 deliverable: live dashboard the client can log into

Do not build anything outside Phase A scope. Every deferred item is documented in
`docs/PRD.md` under "Out of scope."

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never store full transcripts.** Store scores, evidence anchors, rubric metadata, evaluation lineage only.
2. **Never hardcode credentials.** All secrets live in AWS Secrets Manager. Local dev uses `.env` (gitignored).
3. **Always version prompts.** Every prompt has a `prompt_version` field. Increment on any change.
4. **Always version the rubric.** `rubric-v1.yaml` → `rubric-v2.yaml`. Never mutate in place.
5. **Synthetic data only in Phase A.** No real CTM production credentials. Sandbox sub-account only.
6. **N/A is not zero.** Dimensions scored N/A are excluded from the weighted average entirely.
7. **Compliance engine is deterministic first.** Rules and regex detect violations. LLM provides contextual reasoning, not sole authority.

---

## Naming conventions

- Python files: `snake_case.py`
- TypeScript files: `camelCase.ts` / `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- Database tables: `snake_case`
- Environment variables: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Prompt versions: `prompt_v1`, `prompt_v2`
- Rubric versions: `rubric-v1.yaml`, `rubric-v2.yaml`
- Git branches: `feature/short-description`, `fix/short-description`
- Commits: `type(scope): description` — e.g. `feat(scoring): add N/A weight exclusion`

## 17-day build timeline

| Day | Focus |
|---|---|
| D1 | AWS account + baseline infra. **Request Bedrock model access immediately — takes hours to days.** |
| D2 | Rubric session + label schema locked |
| D3 | Synthetic transcripts batch 1 (excellent + family-caller, 12 calls) |
| D4 | Synthetic dataset complete (all 5 scenarios, 30 calls) + S3 populated |
| D5 | CTM ingestion + webhook plumbing live |
| D6 | Scoring engine on Bedrock — first scored call end-to-end |
| D7 | **Buffer 1** |
| D8 | Internal QA — automated Pytest against gold-standard labels |
| D9 | Dashboard build part 1 |
| D10 | Dashboard build part 2 + polish |
| D11 | **Client blind grading session** — see `docs/d11-facilitation-guide.md` |
| D12 | Rubric refinement on disagreements → push rubric-v2 |
| D13 | Rescore + verify success bar (≥80% / ≥70%) |
| D14 | **Buffer 2** |
| D15 | Phase B proposal draft |
| D16 | Readout prep |
| D17 | **Joint readout + Phase B pitch** |

## Infra setup notes

These steps must be completed once per AWS environment before CDK stacks can be deployed.
They are not part of the normal daily build — they are environment prerequisites.

### CDK bootstrap IAM requirement (completed D3)

The `am-copilot-dev` IAM user requires a custom inline policy to run `cdk bootstrap` and
`cdk deploy`. **Do not use `AdministratorAccess`** — follow least-privilege per
`docs/security-spec.md`.

Policy name: `AMCopilot-CDK-Bootstrap-Policy`
Required actions (scoped to this account/region):
- CloudFormation: `CreateStack`, `DescribeStacks`, `DeleteStack`, `UpdateStack`, `GetTemplate`, `CreateChangeSet`, `ExecuteChangeSet`, `DescribeChangeSet`, `DeleteChangeSet`
- S3: `CreateBucket`, `PutBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketVersioning`, `PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`, `PutEncryptionConfiguration`, `GetBucketLocation`, `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `DeleteObject`, `ListBucket`
- ECR: `CreateRepository`, `DescribeRepositories`, `PutLifecyclePolicy`
- SSM: `PutParameter`, `GetParameter`, `DeleteParameter`
- IAM: `CreateRole`, `DeleteRole`, `AttachRolePolicy`, `DetachRolePolicy`, `PutRolePolicy`, `DeleteRolePolicy`, `GetRole`, `PassRole`

If the CDKToolkit stack gets stuck in `ROLLBACK_FAILED`: delete it via the CloudFormation
console (root/admin credentials), then re-run `cdk bootstrap`.

Bootstrap command:
```bash
cd infra && cdk bootstrap aws://{ACCOUNT_ID}/us-east-1 --profile am-copilot-dev
```

### Bedrock quota provisioning (new AWS accounts)

A fresh AWS account may have **all Bedrock inference quotas provisioned at 0** due to an
AWS new-account provisioning bug. This is NOT a code issue — the pipeline is correct.

Symptoms: `ValidationException: The provided model identifier is invalid` when calling
`invoke_model`, even with a valid model ID and correct cross-region inference profile.

Resolution: File an AWS Support case requesting quota increase for:
- `us-east-1` → Amazon Bedrock → Anthropic Claude Sonnet inference throughput
- Check Service Quotas console: all applied account-level values may show 0

Do not modify scoring logic to work around this. The fix is entirely on the AWS side.

**Build-window workaround (D8.5):** `MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic` is enabled in `.env` while the
Bedrock ticket is open. Set `MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock` once quota resolves. See Phase B item 5.

---

## Open questions

| Question | Owner | Must resolve by |
|---|---|---|
| ~~What does CTM `GET /api/v1/calls/{id}` return for the transcript field?~~ **RESOLVED D3** — Two-endpoint model confirmed. See `services/ctm-integration/README.md`. | Dev | ~~D5~~ Done |

### CTM two-endpoint model (resolved)

CTM splits call data: metadata at `GET .../calls/{id}`, transcript at
`GET .../calls/{id}/transcription.json`. The `outline[]` array in the
transcription response is turn-by-turn diarized. Speaker role is determined
by `channel` number (`2=agent`, `1=caller`), not the `speaker` string.

**One Phase B verification still open:** Confirm `channel→role` mapping holds
on real treatment-center data. Mapping is isolated in `CHANNEL_TO_ROLE`
constant in `normalizer.py` for easy update. Do not block Phase A on this.

---

## Phase B — must-do before production

These items are explicitly deferred from Phase A. None of them block the D11 client
grading session. All must be resolved before any non-dev deployment or real patient data.

| # | Item | Location | Action required |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Bearer token verification** | `services/api-gateway/api_gateway/auth.py` · `require_auth()` | Currently accepts any non-empty Bearer token when bypass is off. Replace stub with real Cognito JWT verification (python-jose + JWKS endpoint). |
| 2 | **CTM channel→role mapping** | `services/ctm-integration/ctm_integration/constants.py` · `CHANNEL_TO_ROLE` | Confirm `{2: "agent", 1: "caller"}` mapping holds on real treatment-center CTM data. Mapping is isolated in one constant — update if wrong. |
| 3 | **CTM webhook HMAC-SHA256 signature** | `services/ctm-integration/ctm_integration/webhook.py` | Webhook signature verification against CTM's `X-CTM-Signature` header is not implemented. Verify the exact signing scheme from CTM docs, then add HMAC-SHA256 verification before processing any webhook payload. |
| 4 | **Bedrock quota provisioning + swap-back** | AWS Service Quotas console · `.env MODEL_PROVIDER` | Workaround in place: `MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic` active for build window. When AWS resolves the quota ticket: set `MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock`, run `scripts/score_all_missing.py` against the 30 calls to confirm the Bedrock path works end-to-end, then action item 5 below. This is scaffolding, not a permanent provider abstraction. |
| 5 | **Remove MODEL_PROVIDER switch + AnthropicClient** | `services/scoring-engine/scoring_engine/anthropic_client.py` · `score_arbitrator._make_llm_client()` · `.env MODEL_PROVIDER` · `requirements.txt anthropic` | Build-window scaffolding only. After Bedrock confirmed working: delete `anthropic_client.py`, remove `_make_llm_client()` factory from `score_arbitrator.py`, revert `__init__` to `BedrockClient()` directly, remove `anthropic` from `requirements.txt`, remove `MODEL_PROVIDER`/`ANTHROPIC_*` from env. |
| 6 | **Call list scenario filter bug** | `apps/dashboard/src/pages/CallList.tsx` · `services/scoring-engine/scoring_engine/score_arbitrator.py` · `EvaluationRow.scenario_type` | Filter chips ("Excellent", "Weak", "Family-caller", "Urgency", "Compliance-failure") all show "No calls match" because `scenario_type` is `null` on every result file — the scoring engine doesn't populate it. Two fix paths (decide D11): **Option A** — carry `scenario_type` from the synthetic manifest through the scoring pipeline into `ScoreResult.evaluation.scenario_type` (preserves semantic categorization, requires pipeline changes); **Option B** — replace chips with score-based bands (Excellent ≥80, Weak ≤50, etc.) (faster, loses scenario typing). Target: D11 dashboard polish pass. |
